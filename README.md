# Android Studio project

The following project was made in Android Studio using Kotlin. It's a mockup app designed to make public transport use in the city of Split easier.

The app is far from finished (it was a college project that didn't require us to finish the app), but I look forward to comming back to it one day as
I believe the current official app used by the city has many flaws that can easily be fixed.

## Running the app

The app can be ran using Android Studio's virtual devices (emulating an Android smartphone) or on an actual Android device.
Simply pull the content from this repo, and run it in Android Studio

## Implemented functionalities

-The app currently let's preview 2 bus route's using Google Maps API and drawing vectors on a canvas overlaying it. The idea is to eventualy pull this data from
a database, rather than having it hardcoded in.

-There is a mockup login/register window.

## Project idea

The full idea of the project can be found in the /documentation folder. The documentation is written in Croatian, as it was used for a college project, however,
in case of revisiting the project, an English version will be added as well.
